Description:
    Provides an interface to Blimp software for Bayesian latent variable modeling,
    missing data analysis, and multiple imputation. The package generates Blimp syntax,
    executes Blimp models, and imports results back into R as structured objects with
    methods for visualization and analysis. Requires Blimp software (freely available
    at <https://www.appliedmissingdata.com/blimp>) to be installed separately.
